Running the application: 
Please use an actual android tablet, not your phone. Make sure that the system time and date are correct, and that location services are enabled.
Just plug in the tablet and hit run on android studio and it should work! Ensure that you have the correct ADB drivers installed and you have the developer options enabled on the tablet.


The server should be up, but if you need to launch it, this is what you should do:
1. Go to pythonanywhere.com and login (ask us if you need credentials)
2. In the consoles tab, go to the bash console and update the git project (ask us for credentials)
3. Run 'python manage.py syncdb' within GVBackend directory
4. Go to the web tab and click 'Reload grapevine.pythonanywhere.com'
